# Radwaste-ALARA-Optimization

### Summary

This repository outlines the Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment (QHSE) governance programs implemented to optimize radiological control and waste management processes at a nuclear facility.

### Objectives

*   Minimize radiological waste generation in alignment with RCO (Radiological Control Officer) certification standards.
*   Achieve As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) dose metrics.
*   Generate significant operational and financial efficiencies in waste disposal and outage cycles.

### Achievements & Impact

*   **Waste Minimization:** Minimized radiological waste generation by **25%**, adhering to strict RCO protocols.
*   **Cost Savings:** Delivered annual operational savings exceeding an estimated **$2.5M+** in disposal costs and **2,000 man-hours** per outage cycle.
*   **Dose Achievement:** Achieved the **lowest shutdown cumulative dose** recorded in facility history during a major outage, demonstrating a strong safety culture and engineering approach.
